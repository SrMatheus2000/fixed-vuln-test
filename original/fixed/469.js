	// JM: If you think we should be checking the req.cookie here you don't understand CSRF.
	// On pages loaded from this app (on the same origin) JS will have access to the cookie and should add the CSRF value as one of the headers above.
	// Other pages, like those created by an attacker, can still create requests to this app (to which the browser will add cookie information) but,
	// since the calling page itself can't access the cookie, it will be unable to add the CSRF header, body or query param to the request.
	// The fact that we *don't* check the CSRF value that comes in with the cookie is what makes this CSRF implementation work.
